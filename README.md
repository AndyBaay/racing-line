### Setting up env
- Make sure you are in the root directory of this repo (i.e. /racing-line )
  - Running `pwd` should show a path ending in /racing-line
- Run `python3 -m venv venv`
- Run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual env
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

That should setup your python environment. Confirm it is working by running `python racingline/main.py`
